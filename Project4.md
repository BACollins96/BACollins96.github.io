## Project description

This is a replication of the forktest lab in the xv-6 emulated OS 

## How to compiles / run the program

```
Xv6: use make if not already made, then use make qemu or make qemu-nox. 
Use ./forktest  and a number to test forktest(./forktest 6, for example). 
Make sure you have qemu.
```

## UI Design

Opens an emulated terminal which can be used to access the executable files that are made with the Makefile
